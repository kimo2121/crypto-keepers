        The cryptokeeperz have been roaming the blockchain at the time of lambos
        crashing with rekt HODLERS, looking for blood on the streets. Being moon
        worshippers, they’ve followed the light of the moon to the NFT metaverse
        and are here to take over. Join them in their conquest of an NFT zombie
        apocalypse and help them set up their new families by minting some wives
        and breeding, or get rekt trying to avoid them….. The cryptokeeperz are
        here to stay, the choice is yours…….
